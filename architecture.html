                <p>This is the gallery of Architecture design that I like. In this website, I divide the design pieces with locations. So there are three categories: Asia, Europe and America. </p>

                <div id="asiatext1">
                    <p>The layout of Bee'ah’s new headquarters in Sharjah is determined by its desert environment. The volume of the building resembles a group of interlaced sand dunes, formed at an angle that can adapt to the prevailing northwest wind in the area. The amount of glass and the design of the interior of the building can also ensure high-quality natural light and vision.</p>

                <img id="asiapic2"src="images/harbin.jpeg" alt=""/>
                <div id="asiatext2">
                    <p>Because it is located in the wetland environment of Harbin, the design of the Harbin Opera House echoes the wild spiritual power and harsh climatic conditions of this northern city. The architecture is like being shaped by wind and water, fully integrated into nature and topography, and infused with local characteristics, art and culture.</p>

                <img id="asiapic3" src="images/azh.jpeg" alt=""/>
                <div id="asiatext3">
                    <p>The local government hopes to design this cultural center as a representative building of national cultural undertakings, away from the rigid and monumental Soviet architectural form that prevailed in Baku. On the contrary, it must truly express its feelings for Azerbaijani culture and the country’s attitude towards it. Optimism for the future.</p>

                <div id="europetext1">
                    <p>The Vitra Fire Station, designed for the factory complex of the same name in Weil-am-Rhein, Germany, whose obliquely intersecting concrete planes, which serve to shape and define the street running through the complex, represent the earliest attempt to translate Hadid’s fantastical, powerful conceptual drawings into a functional architectural space.</p>

                <img id="europepic2"src="images/luisvitton.jpeg" alt=""/>
                <div id="europetext2">
                    <p>The building is a tribute to the 19th century glass garden architecture. The architecture reshapes the important position of the Jardin in French culture (especially in the literary works of Marcel Proust), and it also satisfies the city’s demand for a contemporary art museum. Those families and children who often come to the garden to spend time together provide a shared space.</p>

                    <p>Construction of the Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família began in 1882, more than a century ago. It is perhaps the best known structure of Catalan Modernisme, drawing over three million visitors annually. Architect Antoni Gaudi worked on the project until his death in 1926, in full anticipation he would not live to see it finished.</p>

                    <p>Completed October 23, 2003, The Walt Disney Concert Hall celebrates its tenth anniversary today. Home to the LA Philharmonic, it has received wide acclaim for its excellent acoustics and distinctive architecture. In the decade since its opening, the hall's sweeping, metallic surfaces have become associated with Frank Gehry’s signature style.</p>

                    <p>Salk Institute for Biological Sciences has become an emblem of tranquility, enhanced by the symmetrical vistas overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Kahn designed the complex to express an underlying sense of spiritualism, fusing influences from both the International Style and Brutalism anchored by a gently flowing river through the center of the design. </p>

                    <p>Vessel is a new type of public landscape project, surrounded by a circle, with a total of 16 floors, 2465 steps, 80 rest platforms, and a panoramic view of Manhattan and the Hudson River. Vessel is located in the core area of Hudson Yards. Hudson Yards is one of the largest real estate development projects in the history of the United States. The land exceeds 5 acres.</p>
